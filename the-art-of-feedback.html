            <!-- <img src="images/feedback.jpg" alt="person dancing in street"> -->
            <p>It’s that time of year again.  The time of Strictly Come Dancing, The Apprentice, Bonfire Night, Christmas advertising and, of course, the annual performance review. The Marks and Spencer ‘thank you bear’ advert is not the only thing causing controversy. Competing for that crown are the annual performance reviews. To leave employees feeling good this year, this article will look at how best to give feedback and its from an unlikely source that we find inspiration, Strictly Come Dancing. </p>
            <p>Strictly Come Dancing is the X Factor of the dance world. It even has a Simon Cowell equivalent judge in Craig Revel-Horwood. Craig is straight talking, blunt and if the audience get an inkling that what he is about to say in unfavourable, he is booed. Yet there is no denying that the contestants seek his approval over all the judges. The words of Jane Austen in Pride and Prejudice sum it up, "your good opinion is rarely bestowed and therefore more worth the earning".</p>
            <p>Compare this approach to the corporate world. In the modern workplace, managers are often worried about hurting someone’s feelings or they think that their direct reports won’t be able to handle criticism.  Feedback is sugar-coated, hiding its true meaning and intent. It becomes superficial and unspecific feedback, more a tick-box exercise than something that is beneficial to the employee. Generic comments like ‘improve your stakeholder management,’ ‘needs more experience’ or ‘should manage bigger projects’, are all unclear and unhelpful.  This feedback may as well be no feedback at all. </p>
            <p>Constructive feedback, when given properly, will never hurt or demotivate anyone. Feedback given under the pretence of honesty, or as a list of good things followed by a but (employees see through this, they know that what comes after the ‘but’ is the real message), or used as an opportunity to put someone down, is not true feedback. Feedback should only be given if it can help someone improve their performance and reach their potential.</p>

            </article>

            <p class="para-after-aside">Millennials, or Generation Y, want ‘in the moment’ feedback. Instead of waiting until the end of the year, when most performance discussions are held by management behind closed doors, they want to hear about how they are doing right now so they can improve both their current and future performance. It was for this reason that Deloitte announced in 2015 that they were doing away with their annual appraisal. They calculated that two million hours were being spent on reviews each year and the amount of time spent did not match the benefit received. If we are to give regular feedback, we need to know how best to do it. For that, we can apply the Craig Revel-Horwood approach.</p>

            <p class="para-after-aside">
              There are five aspects to Craig’s feedback method:
            </p>

            <ol>
              1.	He gives feedback as soon as the routine has finished. This is the structure of the show, but it should be no different in the corporate world.
            </ol>
            <ol>
              2.	He cuts to the chase. He gets to the point of what he liked and did not like about the performance.
            </ol>
            <ol>
              3.	He works contrary to popular coaching advice on how to give feedback. Instead of throwing in the bad amongst the good, he lists the things that did not work first and then follows it with what, in his opinion, did work. It gives a more balanced view of the performance. If we start off listing all the good bits, employees don't pay attention as they are waiting for the inevitable punch. They lose sight of what went well.
            </ol>
            <ol>
              4.	He keeps it simple. Being told your thumb is sticking up, leaves you in no doubt of what was wrong and how to fix it. Being told your outermost digit was not in the correct position is meaningless and unnecessarily obtuse. Feedback should always be simple and specific.
            </ol>
            <ol>
              5.	He focusses on the performance so it never becomes personal or about whether he likes the contestant or not. This makes his feedback objective and not an attack on someone’s personality or character.
            </ol>
            <p>
              When it comes to feedback, remember that employees do actually want feedback. They want to know what they've done well and what they need to work on to improve their future performance. When feedback is given  constructively, it will never hurt anyone. Given in the right way, with the purpose of improving performance or helping someone reach their potential, will leave a positive mark on that employee forever.
