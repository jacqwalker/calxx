            <p>It’s that time of year again.  The time of Strictly Come Dancing, The Apprentice, Bonfire Night, Christmas advertising and, of course, the annual performance review. The Marks and Spencer ‘thank you bear’ advert is not alone in causing controversy.  I am speaking, of course, of the annual performance reviews. To leave employees feeling good this year, this article will look at how best to give feedback. And, given that it’s that time of year after all, we turn to Strictly Come Dancing for guidance.</p>
            <p>Whether you love or hate Strictly Come Dancing, there is something we can learn from it. Craig Revel-Horwood, one of the show’s judges, is the Simon Cowell of the dance world. He is straight talking, blunt and often booed by the audience. Yet there is no denying that he is the judge that contestants most seek approval from. His approval is worth more the other judges combined so he must be doing something right. </p>
            <p>Compare this to the corporate world. In the modern workplace, employers are often worried about hurting someone’s feelings or think that their employees won’t be able to handle criticism.  The message can be sugar-coated, hiding its true meaning and intent. We are given superficial, unspecific feedback, more a tick-box exercise than something with some real thought involved. Generic comments like ‘improve your stakeholder management,’ ‘needs more experience’ or ‘needs to manage bigger projects’, are all unclear and unhelpful.  Unclear and unhelpful feedback may as well be no feedback at all. </p>
            <p>Constructive feedback, when given properly, will never hurt or demotivate anyone. Feedback given under the pretence of honesty, or as a list of good things followed by a but (employees see through this, they know that what comes after the ‘but’ is the real message), or even using feedback as an opportunity to put someone down, is not true feedback. Feedback should only be given if it can help someone improve their performance and reach their potential.</p>

            <p class="para-after-aside">Millennials, or Generation Y, want ‘in the moment’ feedback. Instead of waiting until the end of the year, when most performance discussions are held by management behind closed doors, they want to hear about how they are doing right now so they can improve both their current and future performance. It was for this reason that Deloitte announced in 2015 that they were doing away with their annual appraisal. They calculated that two million hours were being spent on reviews each year and the amount of time spent did not match the benefit received. If we are to give regular feedback, we need to know how best to do it. For that, we can turn to the Craig Revel-Horwood method.</p>
            <p>
              There are five aspects to Craig’s feedback approach:
            </p>

            <ol>
              1.	He gives feedback as soon as the routine has finished. This is the structure of the show, but it should be no different in the corporate world.
            </ol>
            <ol>
              2.	He cuts to the chase. He gets to the point of what he liked and did not like about the performance.
            </ol>
            <ol>
              3.	He works contrary to popular coaching advice on how to give feedback. Instead of throwing in the bad amongst the good, he lists the things that did not work first and then follows it with what, in his opinion, did work. It gives a more balanced view of the performance. Contestants are not left waiting for the inevitable punch so that they lose sight of what went well.
            </ol>
            <ol>
              4.	He keeps it simple. Being told your thumb is sticking up, leaves you in no doubt of the feedback and is easy to fix. Being told your outermost digit was not in the correct position is meaningless and unnecessarily obtuse. Feedback should always be simple and specific.
            </ol>
            <ol>
              5.	He focusses on the performance, so whether he likes the contestant or not is irrelevant. This makes his feedback objective and not an attack on someone’s personality or character.
            </ol>
            <p>
              When it comes to feedback, remember that employees want feedback to help them improve and when given constructively, will never hurt anyone. Given in the right way, with the purpose of improving performance or helping someone reach their potential, will leave a positive mark on that employee forever.
