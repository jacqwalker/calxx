              <p class="bold-para">Companies have just one more week to report on their gender pay gap. With 5,173 submissions by 2 pm this Wednesday, office workers won’t be limited to discussing the Facebook Cambridge Analytics scandal at the water cooler as the gender pay gap data provides some interesting talking points.</p>
              <h3>What is the gender pay gap?</h3>
              <p>For the first time, UK companies with more than 250 employees are required to report on their gender pay gap. An estimated 9,000 public sector and private companies are expected to report by 31st March and 4th April respectively.</p>
              <p>The gender pay gap is the difference between what firms pay their male and female staff. The pay gap is different to equal pay which requires companies to pay men and women equally for the same role. Equal pay has been a legal requirement since 1970.</p>
              <h3>What is the data telling us so far?</h3>
              <p>Early findings show that 79% of companies pay men more, while 8% have no imbalance. 30% of companies have a higher gender pay gap than the national average of 18.4% (includes full-time and part-time workers).</p>
              <p>As companies are required to report by legal entity, different parts of the business can have varying results. For example, Sainsbury’s Bank has a 45.3% pay gap, but across the Sainsbury UK Group, it is 18.4%.
              </p>

                <div class="blog-aside-div">
                   Premier Oil 53% | Tullow Oil 49% | Anglo American 49% | TUI Travel 47% | EasyJet 46% | St James Place Wealth Management 46% | Asos 41% | Worldpay 40% | Credit Suisse 39% | Virgin Money 38% | Rightmove 37% | British American Tobacco 36%*

                      * The numbers represent the median pay gap. These numbers are consolidated for all legal entities in the company and the data was obtained from the company’s gender pay gap report. A full list can be obtained at  https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/Viewing/download

              </article>

              <p class="para-after-aside">Banking, aviation, mining and oil and gas companies show a significant pay gap. The reports indicate not only an underrepresentation of women in senior and technical roles but also in the workforce. In the oil and gas sector, for example, only 20% of the workforce is female. </p>
              <p>
                In the aviation sector, 95% of pilots are male compared to a 70% to 80% female cabin crew. Pilots earn £111,000 per year on average contributing to a significant pay gap as the cabin crew earn approximately £27,000.
              </p>
              <p>
                It can be challenging for companies in these sectors to attract suitably qualified women as a lower proportion of women study STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths) at school and university.
              </p>

              <p class="para-after-aside">
                <h3>What can be done going forward?</h3>
                With a lack of women in senior and technical roles, and in the workforce, companies admit more can be done to improve the imbalance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Common themes to address this include looking at flexible working environments, mentoring and networking, creating new career opportunities and forming diversity and inclusion committees.
              </p>
              <p>
                While some of these initiatives will work, companies should consider what can be done to encourage young girls into the STEM field, as traditionally qualifications in this area lead to more opportunities. Like ASOS are doing.
              </p>

              <article class="blog-aside">
                <div class="blog-aside-div">
                  “At ASOS, we are committed to funding 10 scholarships per year to encourage more women to study STEM topics in universities and expand the work we are currently doing with schools and organisations like Stemettes and Girls Who Code” – ASOS gender pay gap report
                </div>
              </article>

              <p class="para-after-aside">
                It shouldn’t just be the companies’ responsibility. While bias does still exist in the workplace, there is also bias in the home or at school as to which careers are suitable for young boys and girls.
              </p>
              <p>
                Are girls actively encouraged to enter the oil and gas sector or become pilots? Are boys encouraged to take on nurturing or teaching roles? And who is leading these discussions?
              </p>
              <p>
                Consider Phase Eight, a women’s fashion retailer, who has a gender pay gap of 54.5%. In favour of men. Their workforce is 97% female who primarily work on the shop floor. 89% of the male employees are based at head office and paid significantly more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Do customers prefer female shop assistants? But if we want diversity in the workplace, we need it in all aspects of our life. A man’s opinion on what to wear could prove invaluable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Or Yellow Dot Nursery, a nursery school specialising in children aged between four months and five years. They have a gender pay gap of 80.6% in favour of women. They said they “are working hard to encourage men to join our team and be promoted upwards through our organisation”.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why are men not working in nursery schools? Was it considered an unsuitable profession for them?
              </p>
              <p>
                Men and women should be encouraged into any company, at shop level so to speak, as that is where one learns about a business. It’s the 1960s equivalent of starting in the mailroom.
              </p>
              <p>
                Graduate programs and apprenticeships try and fill this gap but overcoming the inherent bias of what constitutes a suitable career based on gender, will be challenging.
              </p>
              <h3>In conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                The data shows the need to create a more diverse, equal and inclusive workforce. It needs to filter through the system and parents, schools and universities are necessary for that change to happen. It will be interesting to see how the numbers, industries and workforce change in the coming years.
