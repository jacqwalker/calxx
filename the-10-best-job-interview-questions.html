            <p>We know the drill when preparing for interviews.</p>
            <p>Be prepared to talk through your CV succinctly, in a few minutes. Elevator pitch style. </p>
            <p>Articulate how your experience is relevant to the job description.</p>
            <p>Provide examples of a difficult stakeholder you needed to manage; how you persuaded someone to see your point of view; how you dealt with underperformance.</p>
            <p>Share you strengths and areas for development. </p>
            <p>In an hour interview, they spend 45 to 50 minutes asking questions. Then you have 10 minutes to ask yours.</p>
            <p>While some want to use the time to find out more and may not be sure of where to start, others are only concerned with asking questions which they think will make a good impression.</p>
            <p>What we seem to have lost sight of, is that this interview is as much about us finding out about them, as they are us.</p>
            <p>When you think about it, what can you really learn about something that you spend at least 50% of your waking hours in, in 10 minutes? You spend more time trying on a new pair of shoes. And shoes are easy to exchange if they prove to be a bad fit.</p>
            <p>If we treat the interview as a dialogue, we can work our questions into the interview rather than waiting until the allocated slot at the end. That doesn't mean when they ask 'what experience is relevant to this role' that it’s countered with 'what experience are you looking for'. </p>

            <p class="para-after-aside">Instead, if they ask how you deal with underperformance, once you’ve finished answering you can ask if there have been any issues of underperformance in the team. This is easy to do when it feels like a conversation. And more importantly, questions asked in this manner can uncover things that would not have been disclosed ordinarily.</p>

            <p>The 80% imbalance of interview time needs to be a thing of the past; so we have put together questions that need answering in every job interview.</p>
            <p>1. How does this role help the organisation achieve its goals / strategy? (how they answer this question will give good insight into how closely this role is linked to the company’s mission and how much thought they have given to it. They should be able to give a clear answer which shows the have bought into the company's mission and have passion for it)</p>
            <p>2. What would you expect from the new hire in the first 90 days and how do you measure their performance? (we like this question because it shows whether they view you as just filling a gap or whether they have thought what they want the next person to achieve and how they want to move the role forward)</p>
            <p>3. Why did you join this company? (this is a favourite of ours as you want to work for someone who is passionate about what they do and who they work for)</p>
            <p>4. How did this role come about? (If the vacancy is due to an internal promotion, it indicates that people do progress and move in the organisation. If the person has left the organisation, you might want to explore why they did)</p>
            <p>5. How long was the incumbent in the role? (If it’s less than a year, this is a red flag. If it’s more than four years, there may be limited scope for advancement. The incumbent might not have been the right fit or they have plateaued in their career but some LinkedIn stalking should help you determine that)</p>
            <p>6. What do you enjoy the most about your job? And flipping it, the least (Interviewers can easily sell a role from a rehearsed script, mentioning all the good bits and overlooking the pain points. But when you make it personal about what they like and don’t like, you get a much more authentic answer)</p>
            <p>7. What are some of the key skills that the new hire will learn in this role? (You would expect some of the skills they mention to be ones you already possess, that’s why they are interviewing you. However, you need to be certain that this role will help you develop new skills) </p>
            <p>8. What is the companies work / life balance like? (If the work / life balance is really good in an organisation, they would've bragged about this already) </p>
            <p>9. What is the department make up and what are their qualifications? (who is it that said you are the average of the five people you spend time with?)</p>
            <p>10. Who are the key stakeholders and where are they based? (having virtual stakeholders is becoming more common but if they are based in Asia or the Americas, this could change the structure of your work day if you need to take early morning or late afternoon calls)</p>
            <p>And remember, don’t be afraid to have something repeated or clarified. The extra minutes spent in the interview could save you down the line.</p>
